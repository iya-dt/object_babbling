# All settings in this file will be uploaded to the parameter server under the project namespace:
# /namespace/params/setting_1 ... setting_n
#
# Parameters declared as <arg name="arg_param" default="param_value"/>
#                          <node name="node_name" pkg="package" type="node_type" ns="namespace" output="screen">
#                            <param name="param" type="double" value="$(arg arg_param)"/>
#
# inside launch files will be uploaded to the parameter server under the node's namespace:
# /namespace/node_name/param
#
# The guideline would be to put commonly used/shared parameters under the namespace and parameters specific to a node
# under the node's namespace.
